# Codtechit_solutions_task2
Hello! My name is Thahliya, and I hold an MSc in Mathematics. Currently, I am building expertise in data science and machine learning by working with tools such as Python, Power BI, Excel, and MySQL. I enjoy uncovering meaningful insights from data and applying mathematical concepts to real-world problems. This project is a practical implementation of regression modeling, showcasing my ability to work with continuous datasets and build predictive models.

About the Task
Task Overview
This project involves implementing a simple linear regression model using Python. The goal is to explore the relationship between two continuous variables and make predictions based on the model. The steps include splitting the data into training and testing sets, training the model on the training data, evaluating its performance, and visualizing the results. This task demonstrates the practical application of statistical modeling to derive insights and assess predictive accuracy.

Steps Followed
Data Preparation:

Loaded the dataset and inspected its structure for usability.
Selected the independent (predictor) and dependent (target) variables for regression.
Cleaned and preprocessed the data to ensure consistency and readiness for modeling.
Splitting the Data:

Divided the dataset into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets using Python's scikit-learn library.
Model Training:

Trained a simple linear regression model on the training dataset using scikit-learn's LinearRegression class.
Model Evaluation:

Evaluated the model's performance using metrics such as:
Mean Squared Error (MSE): To measure the average squared difference between actual and predicted values.
R-squared (R²): To determine the proportion of variance explained by the model.
Predictions on Test Data:

Used the trained model to predict the target variable for the test dataset.
Visualization:

Plotted the regression line against the actual data points to visualize the fit.
Created a scatter plot comparing actual versus predicted values to assess accuracy.
Key Insights:

Summarized the model’s performance, highlighting its ability to predict the target variable and any observed limitations.
